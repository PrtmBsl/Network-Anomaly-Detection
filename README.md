The dataset contained detailed records of network activities, capturing various attributes associated with network connections. Each record was labeled to indicate whether the activity is normal or a "Neptune" attack, providing a foundation for binomial classification.
A Neptune attack, also known as a SYN flood attack, is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack where an attacker overwhelms a target system with a high number of SYN requests, causing the system to become unresponsive to legitimate traffic. It exploits the TCP handshake process to consume resources on the target machine.
The training set contained 86,845 rows, including whether the activity (column - Attack) was normal or not. 
Multiple machine learning models were tried before Random Forest Classifier was adopted. The Random Forest was also run with different parameters and the one chosen finally gives maximum F1 score -100 on the train-test split data and 99.9817 on the final testing dataset. 
This project was created as part of the AI Planet Network Anomaly Detection Hackathon 2024 by CAC IIT Guwahati, where I received All India Rank 109.
