The dataset contains detailed records of network activities, capturing various attributes associated with network connections. Each record is labeled to indicate whether the activity is normal or a "Neptune" attack, providing a foundation for binomial classification.
A Neptune attack, also known as a SYN flood attack, is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack where an attacker overwhelms a target system with a high number of SYN requests, causing the system to become unresponsive to legitimate traffic. It exploits the TCP handshake process to consume resources on the target machine.
The training set contains 86,845 rows, including whether the activity (column - Attack) is normal or not. 
Mulitiple machine learning models were tried befire Random Forest was adopted since it gave maximum F1 score (100) on the train-test split data and 99.9817 on the final testing dataset.
